## Code Comments:

Please look through my pull request and read through the inline code comments I left for specific notes on your code. Here's the link if you need it.

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**2: Performing.** If you get around to working on this project again, the next feature I would implement is so that if the user clicks on an incorrect circle, they are immediately taken to the "You Lose" page. This is as opposed to, for example, having to click 5 circles in Round 5 before it is determined whether the user has lost or not.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**3: Excelling.** Your code was extra readable, which is a big plus in my book. Big fan of the organization as well and breaking down chunks of functionality into separate functions. Made understanding your code (without comments) very easy. Keep it up.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**2: Performing.** I'm a sucker for minimalist design. That worked out well here. I made a suggestion or two re: user experience in my inline comments, but nothing too crazy.
